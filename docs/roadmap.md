# üõ§Ô∏è Roadmap

We have several improvements and features to be added to the GameOutlet. Here are the things that we want to implement
in a near future:
- [x] **Latest deals:** Show the latest deals in the home screen.  
- [x] **Game search:** Search by your favourite games
- [ ] **Windows version:** Game Outlet fully functional in windows hosts
- [ ] **Wishlist:** Mark a game as favourite and easily get back to it to see its prices
- [ ] **Stores:** Show the list of available stores and show the deals from this store
- [ ] **Theme selection:** Select users preferred theme from the settings section
- [ ] **Alerts:** Get a notification when a favourite game's price drops

New ideas are always welcome. Feel free to use the [discussions section](https://github.com/AppOutlet/GameOutlet/discussions) to suggest more!
