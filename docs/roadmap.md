# üõ§Ô∏è Roadmap

We have several improvements and features to be added to the GameOutlet. Here are the things that we want to implement
in the near future:
- [x] **Latest deals:** Show the latest deals on the home screen.  
- [x] **Game-search:** Search by your favourite games
- [x] **Windows version:** Game Outlet fully functional in windows hosts
- [x] **Wishlist:** Mark a game as a favorite and easily get back to it to see its prices
- [x] **Stores:** Show the list of available stores and show the deals from this store
- [x] **Theme selection:** Select users preferred theme from the settings section
- [ ] **Alerts:** Get a notification when a favorite game's price drops
- [ ] **Currency conversion:** Convert the prices to a local currency

New ideas are always welcome. Feel free to use the [discussions section](https://github.com/AppOutlet/GameOutlet/discussions) to suggest more!
